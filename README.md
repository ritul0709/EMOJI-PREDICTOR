📘 Overview of the Project
The Emoji Predictor is a simple, interactive Python program that predicts a random mood each time it runs. It uses a list of predefined moods—each containing a name, emoji, and a short message—and displays one based on random selection.
This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as lists, tuples, modules, randomization, and user interaction, making it ideal for beginners.

🧪 Instructions for Testing
To test the project:
1. Run the program multiple times — each run should show a different mood depending on randomness.
2. Check emoji display — ensure your terminal supports emoji output.
3. Add or remove mood entries in the mood list to test customization.
4. (Optional) Test a loop where the user chooses to predict their mood again.
5. Verify that no errors appear even if the program is run repeatedly.
