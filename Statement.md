Project Statement – Emoji Predictor

📝 Problem Statement

People often experience different emotions throughout the day, and sometimes they look for a fun, light-hearted way to reflect on or guess their mood. The goal of this project is to create a simple Python program that predicts a random mood using emojis and short messages.
This helps beginners understand Python basics while providing users with an enjoyable and interactive experience.

🎯 Scope of the Project

The project focuses on generating a random mood from a predefined list.

It includes mood names, emojis, and short motivational messages.

The system does not analyze real emotions; it only predicts mood for fun.

The scope is limited to a terminal-based (text-based) Python program for now.

The project can be extended later to include GUI, audio, or machine learning features.
